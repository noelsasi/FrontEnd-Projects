# webdevelopment
In this I'll be sharing my files and modules I've done.  I'll share the code along with screen shots because the code is in php most, you cant simply run the file unless you have xampp or any server. 

- doctorslist file contains php code of panels with doctors list and its responsive also, see the code and screenshot will give you nice idea.
- design html page you can also try, I've uploaded both html and css page and the png image resembles the exact view of the webpage.
